"""The inspection module provides the :func:`_sa.inspect` function,
which delivers runtime information about a wide variety
of SQLAlchemy objects, both within the Core as well as the
ORM.

The :func:`_sa.inspect` function is the entry point to SQLAlchemy's
public API for viewing the configuration and construction
of in-memory objects.   Depending on the type of object
passed to :func:`_sa.inspect`, the return value will either be
a related object which provides a known interface, or in many
cases it will return the object itself.

The rationale for :func:`_sa.inspect` is twofold.  One is that
it replaces the need to be aware of a large variety of "information
getting" functions in SQLAlchemy, such as
<<<<<<< HEAD
:meth:`_reflection.Inspector.from_engine`,
=======
:meth:`_reflection.Inspector.from_engine` (deprecated in 1.4),
>>>>>>> 516a66495 (Reinitialize repository and add files)
:func:`.orm.attributes.instance_state`, :func:`_orm.class_mapper`,
and others.    The other is that the return value of :func:`_sa.inspect`
is guaranteed to obey a documented API, thus allowing third party
tools which build on top of SQLAlchemy configurations to be constructed
in a forwards-compatible way.
