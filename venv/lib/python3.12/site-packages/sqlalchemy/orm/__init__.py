      database access in the created
      :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session`.

    :param \*\*kwargs: optional, passed through to the
      :class:`.Session` constructor.

    :returns: an :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session` instance

    The defaults of create_session() are the opposite of that of
    :func:`sessionmaker`; ``autoflush`` and ``expire_on_commit`` are
    False, ``autocommit`` is True.  In this sense the session acts
    more like the "classic" SQLAlchemy 0.3 session with these.

    Usage::

      >>> from sqlalchemy.orm import create_session

    This function removes all instrumentation from classes and disposes

    and can be later re-mapped with new mappers.

    :func:`.clear_mappers` is *not* for normal use, as there is literally no
    valid usage for it outside of very specific testing scenarios. Normally,
    mappers are permanent structural components of user-defined classes, and
    are never discarded independently of their class.  If a mapped class
    itself is garbage collected, its mapper is automatically disposed of as
    well. As such, :func:`.clear_mappers` is only for usage in test suites
    that re-use the same classes with different mappings, which is itself an
    extremely rare use case - the only such use case is in fact SQLAlchemy's
    own test suite, and possibly the test suites of other ORM extension
    libraries which intend to test various combinations of mapper construction
