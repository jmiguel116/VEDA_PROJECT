class SessionTransaction(object):
    """A :class:`.Session`-level transaction.

    :class:`.SessionTransaction` is a mostly behind-the-scenes object
    not normally referenced directly by application code.   It coordinates
    among multiple :class:`_engine.Connection` objects, maintaining a database
    transaction for each one individually, committing or rolling them
    back all at once.   It also provides optional two-phase commit behavior
    which can augment this coordination operation.

    The :attr:`.Session.transaction` attribute of :class:`.Session`
    refers to the current :class:`.SessionTransaction` object in use, if any.
    The :attr:`.SessionTransaction.parent` attribute refers to the parent
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` in the stack of :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    objects.  If this attribute is ``None``, then this is the top of the stack.
    If non-``None``, then this :class:`.SessionTransaction` refers either
    to a so-called "subtransaction" or a "nested" transaction.  A
    "subtransaction" is a scoping concept that demarcates an inner portion
    of the outermost "real" transaction.  A nested transaction, which
    is indicated when the :attr:`.SessionTransaction.nested`
    attribute is also True, indicates that this :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    corresponds to a SAVEPOINT.

    **Life Cycle**

    A :class:`.SessionTransaction` is associated with a :class:`.Session` in
    its default mode of ``autocommit=False`` immediately, associated
    with no database connections.  As the :class:`.Session` is called upon
    to emit SQL on behalf of various :class:`_engine.Engine` or
    :class:`_engine.Connection`
    objects, a corresponding :class:`_engine.Connection` and associated
    :class:`.Transaction` is added to a collection within the
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` object, becoming one of the
    connection/transaction pairs maintained by the
    :class:`.SessionTransaction`.  The start of a :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    can be tracked using the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_transaction_create`
    event.

    The lifespan of the :class:`.SessionTransaction` ends when the
    :meth:`.Session.commit`, :meth:`.Session.rollback` or
    :meth:`.Session.close` methods are called.  At this point, the
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` removes its association with its parent
    :class:`.Session`.   A :class:`.Session` that is in ``autocommit=False``
    mode will create a new :class:`.SessionTransaction` to replace it
    immediately, whereas a :class:`.Session` that's in ``autocommit=True``
    mode will remain without a :class:`.SessionTransaction` until the
    :meth:`.Session.begin` method is called.  The end of a
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` can be tracked using the
    :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_transaction_end` event.

    **Nesting and Subtransactions**

    Another detail of :class:`.SessionTransaction` behavior is that it is
    capable of "nesting".  This means that the :meth:`.Session.begin` method
    can be called while an existing :class:`.SessionTransaction` is already
    present, producing a new :class:`.SessionTransaction` that temporarily
    replaces the parent :class:`.SessionTransaction`.   When a
    :class:`.SessionTransaction` is produced as nested, it assigns itself to
    the :attr:`.Session.transaction` attribute, and it additionally will assign
    the previous :class:`.SessionTransaction` to its :attr:`.Session.parent`
    attribute.  The behavior is effectively a
    stack, where :attr:`.Session.transaction` refers to the current head of
    the stack, and the :attr:`.SessionTransaction.parent` attribute allows
    traversal up the stack until :attr:`.SessionTransaction.parent` is
    ``None``, indicating the top of the stack.

    When the scope of :class:`.SessionTransaction` is ended via
    :meth:`.Session.commit` or :meth:`.Session.rollback`, it restores its
    parent :class:`.SessionTransaction` back onto the
    :attr:`.Session.transaction` attribute.

    The purpose of this stack is to allow nesting of
    :meth:`.Session.rollback` or :meth:`.Session.commit` calls in context
    with various flavors of :meth:`.Session.begin`. This nesting behavior
    applies to when :meth:`.Session.begin_nested` is used to emit a
    SAVEPOINT transaction, and is also used to produce a so-called
    "subtransaction" which allows a block of code to use a
    begin/rollback/commit sequence regardless of whether or not its enclosing
    code block has begun a transaction.  The :meth:`.flush` method, whether
    called explicitly or via autoflush, is the primary consumer of the
    "subtransaction" feature, in that it wishes to guarantee that it works
    within in a transaction block regardless of whether or not the
    :class:`.Session` is in transactional mode when the method is called.

    Note that the flush process that occurs within the "autoflush" feature
    as well as when the :meth:`.Session.flush` method is used **always**
    creates a :class:`.SessionTransaction` object.   This object is normally
    a subtransaction, unless the :class:`.Session` is in autocommit mode
    and no transaction exists at all, in which case it's the outermost
    transaction.   Any event-handling logic or other inspection logic
    needs to take into account whether a :class:`.SessionTransaction`
    is the outermost transaction, a subtransaction, or a "nested" / SAVEPOINT
    transaction.

          .. warning::

             The autocommit flag is **not for general use**, and if it is
             used, queries should only be invoked within the span of a
             :meth:`.Session.begin` / :meth:`.Session.commit` pair.  Executing
             queries outside of a demarcated transaction is a legacy mode
             of usage, and can in some cases lead to concurrent connection
             checkouts.

          Defaults to ``False``. When ``True``, the
          :class:`.Session` does not keep a persistent transaction running,
          and will acquire connections from the engine on an as-needed basis,
          returning them immediately after their use. Flushes will begin and
          commit (or possibly rollback) their own transaction if no
          transaction is present. When using this mode, the
          :meth:`.Session.begin` method is used to explicitly start
          transactions.

        :param autoflush: When ``True``, all query operations will issue a
           :meth:`~.Session.flush` call to this ``Session`` before proceeding.
           This is a convenience feature so that :meth:`~.Session.flush` need
           not be called repeatedly in order for database queries to retrieve
<<<<<<< HEAD
           results. It's typical that ``autoflush`` is used in conjunction
           with ``autocommit=False``. In this scenario, explicit calls to
           :meth:`~.Session.flush` are rarely needed; you usually only need to
           call :meth:`~.Session.commit` (which flushes) to finalize changes.

           operations performed by this session will execute via this
           connectable.

        :param binds: A dictionary which may specify any number of
           :class:`_engine.Engine` or :class:`_engine.Connection`
           objects as the source of
           connectivity for SQL operations on a per-entity basis.   The keys
           of the dictionary consist of any series of mapped classes,
           arbitrary Python classes that are bases for mapped classes,
           :class:`_schema.Table` objects and :class:`_orm.Mapper` objects.
           The
           values of the dictionary are then instances of

           operation.    The complete heuristics for resolution are

        :param join_transaction_mode: Describes the transactional behavior to
          take when a given bind is a :class:`_engine.Connection` that
          has already begun a transaction outside the scope of this
          :class:`_orm.Session`; in other words the
          :meth:`_engine.Connection.in_transaction()` method returns True.

          The following behaviors only take effect when the :class:`_orm.Session`
          **actually makes use of the connection given**; that is, a method
          such as :meth:`_orm.Session.execute`, :meth:`_orm.Session.connection`,
          etc. are actually invoked:

          * ``"conditional_savepoint"`` - this is the default.  if the given
            :class:`_engine.Connection` is begun within a transaction but
            does not have a SAVEPOINT, then ``"rollback_only"`` is used.
            If the :class:`_engine.Connection` is additionally within
            a SAVEPOINT, in other words
            :meth:`_engine.Connection.in_nested_transaction()` method returns
            True, then ``"create_savepoint"`` is used.

            ``"conditional_savepoint"`` behavior attempts to make use of
            savepoints in order to keep the state of the existing transaction
            unchanged, but only if there is already a savepoint in progress;
            otherwise, it is not assumed that the backend in use has adequate
            support for SAVEPOINT, as availability of this feature varies.
            ``"conditional_savepoint"`` also seeks to establish approximate
            backwards compatibility with previous :class:`_orm.Session`
            behavior, for applications that are not setting a specific mode. It
            is recommended that one of the explicit settings be used.

          * ``"create_savepoint"`` - the :class:`_orm.Session` will use
            :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin_nested()` in all cases to create
            its own transaction.  This transaction by its nature rides
            "on top" of any existing transaction that's opened on the given
            :class:`_engine.Connection`; if the underlying database and
            the driver in use has full, non-broken support for SAVEPOINT, the
            external transaction will remain unaffected throughout the
            lifespan of the :class:`_orm.Session`.

            The ``"create_savepoint"`` mode is the most useful for integrating
            a :class:`_orm.Session` into a test suite where an externally
            initiated transaction should remain unaffected; however, it relies
            on proper SAVEPOINT support from the underlying driver and
            database.

            .. tip:: When using SQLite, the SQLite driver included through
               Python 3.11 does not handle SAVEPOINTs correctly in all cases
               without workarounds. See the sections
               :ref:`pysqlite_serializable` and :ref:`aiosqlite_serializable`
               for details on current workarounds.

          * ``"control_fully"`` - the :class:`_orm.Session` will take
            control of the given transaction as its own;
            :meth:`_orm.Session.commit` will call ``.commit()`` on the
            transaction, :meth:`_orm.Session.rollback` will call
            ``.rollback()`` on the transaction, :meth:`_orm.Session.close` will
            call ``.rollback`` on the transaction.

            .. tip:: This mode of use is equivalent to how SQLAlchemy 1.4 would
               handle a :class:`_engine.Connection` given with an existing
               SAVEPOINT (i.e. :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin_nested`); the
               :class:`_orm.Session` would take full control of the existing
               SAVEPOINT.

          * ``"rollback_only"`` - the :class:`_orm.Session` will take control
            of the given transaction for ``.rollback()`` calls only;
            ``.commit()`` calls will not be propagated to the given
            transaction.  ``.close()`` calls will have no effect on the
            given transaction.

            .. tip:: This mode of use is equivalent to how SQLAlchemy 1.4 would
               handle a :class:`_engine.Connection` given with an existing
               regular database transaction (i.e.
               :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin`); the :class:`_orm.Session`
               would propagate :meth:`_orm.Session.rollback` calls to the
               underlying transaction, but not :meth:`_orm.Session.commit` or
               :meth:`_orm.Session.close` calls.

            This is essentially a **legacy mode of use** and is
            not necessary for new applications.    The :class:`.Session`
            normally handles the work of "begin" transparently, which in

            transactions; there is **no need to explicitly begin transactions**
            when using modern :class:`.Session` programming patterns.
            In its default mode of ``autocommit=False``, the
            :class:`.Session` does all of its work within
            the context of a transaction, so as soon as you call
            :meth:`.Session.commit`, the next transaction is implicitly
            started when the next database operation is invoked.  See
            :ref:`session_autocommit` for further background.

        The method will raise an error if this :class:`.Session` is already
        inside of a transaction, unless
        :paramref:`~.Session.begin.subtransactions` or
        :paramref:`~.Session.begin.nested` are specified.  A "subtransaction"
        is essentially a code embedding pattern that does not affect the
        transactional state of the database connection unless a rollback is
        emitted, in which case the whole transaction is rolled back.  For

        results of the statement execution, in the same manner as that of an
        :class:`_engine.Engine` or
        :class:`_engine.Connection`.

        E.g.::

            result = session.execute(
                        user_table.select().where(user_table.c.id == 5)
                    )

        :meth:`~.Session.execute` accepts any executable clause construct,
        such as :func:`_expression.select`,
        :func:`_expression.insert`,
        :func:`_expression.update`,
        :func:`_expression.delete`, and
        :func:`_expression.text`.  Plain SQL strings can be passed
        as well, which in the case of :meth:`.Session.execute` only
        will be interpreted the same as if it were passed via a
        :func:`_expression.text` construct.  That is, the following usage::

            result = session.execute(
                        "SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=:param",
                        {"param":5}
                    )

        is equivalent to::

            from sqlalchemy import text
            result = session.execute(
                        text("SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=:param"),
                        {"param":5}
                    )

        The second positional argument to :meth:`.Session.execute` is an
        optional parameter set.  Similar to that of
        :meth:`_engine.Connection.execute`, whether this is passed as a single
        dictionary, or a sequence of dictionaries, determines whether the DBAPI
        cursor's ``execute()`` or ``executemany()`` is used to execute the
        statement.   An INSERT construct may be invoked for a single row::

            result = session.execute(
                users.insert(), {"id": 7, "name": "somename"})

        or for multiple rows::

            result = session.execute(users.insert(), [
                                    {"id": 7, "name": "somename7"},
                                    {"id": 8, "name": "somename8"},
                                    {"id": 9, "name": "somename9"}
                                ])

        The statement is executed within the current transactional context of
        this :class:`.Session`.   The :class:`_engine.Connection`
        which is used
        to execute the statement can also be acquired directly by
        calling the :meth:`.Session.connection` method.  Both methods use
        a rule-based resolution scheme in order to determine the
        :class:`_engine.Connection`,
        which in the average case is derived directly
        from the "bind" of the :class:`.Session` itself, and in other cases
        can be based on the :func:`.mapper`
        and :class:`_schema.Table` objects passed to the method; see the
        documentation for :meth:`.Session.get_bind` for a full description of
        this scheme.

        The :meth:`.Session.execute` method does *not* invoke autoflush.

        The :class:`_engine.ResultProxy` returned by the
        :meth:`.Session.execute`
        method is returned with the "close_with_result" flag set to true;
        the significance of this flag is that if this :class:`.Session` is
        autocommitting and does not have a transaction-dedicated
        :class:`_engine.Connection` available, a temporary
        :class:`_engine.Connection` is
        established for the statement execution, which is closed (meaning,
        returned to the connection pool) when the :class:`_engine.ResultProxy`
        has
        consumed all available data. This applies *only* when the
        :class:`.Session` is configured with autocommit=True and no
        transaction has been started.

        :param clause:
            An executable statement (i.e. an :class:`.Executable` expression
            such as :func:`_expression.select`) or string SQL statement
            to be executed.

        The "bind" is usually an instance of :class:`_engine.Engine`,

        explicitly bound directly to a :class:`_engine.Connection`.

        For a multiply-bound or unbound :class:`.Session`, the
        ``mapper`` or ``clause`` arguments are used to determine the
        appropriate bind to return.

        when :meth:`.Session.get_bind` is called via an ORM
        operation such as a :meth:`.Session.query`, each
        individual INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operation within a
        :meth:`.Session.flush`, call, etc.

        1. if mapper given and :paramref:`.Session.binds` is present,
           locate a bind based first on the mapper in use, then
           on the mapped class in use, then on any base classes that are
           present in the ``__mro__`` of the mapped class, from more specific
           superclasses to more general.
        2. if clause given and ``Session.binds`` is present,
           locate a bind based on :class:`_schema.Table` objects
           found in the given clause present in ``Session.binds``.
        3. if ``Session.binds`` is present, return that.
        4. if clause given, attempt to return a bind
           linked to the :class:`_schema.MetaData` ultimately
           associated with the clause.
        5. if mapper given, attempt to return a bind

           associated with the :class:`_schema.Table` or other
           selectable to which the mapper is mapped.
        6. No bind can be found, :exc:`~sqlalchemy.exc.UnboundExecutionError`
           is raised.

        Note that the :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method can be overridden on
        a user-defined subclass of :class:`.Session` to provide any kind

        .. tip::

            While the :meth:`_orm.Session.refresh` method is capable of
            refreshing both column and relationship oriented attributes, its
            primary focus is on refreshing of local column-oriented attributes
            on a single instance. For more open ended "refresh" functionality,
            including the ability to refresh the attributes on many objects at
            once while having explicit control over relationship loader
            strategies, use the
            :ref:`populate existing <orm_queryguide_populate_existing>` feature
            instead.

        Note that a highly isolated transaction will return the same values as
        were previously read in that same transaction, regardless of changes
        in database state outside of that transaction.   Refreshing

        .. versionadded:: 1.4 Added :meth:`_orm.Session.get`, which is moved
           from the now legacy :meth:`_orm.Query.get` method.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` is special in that it provides direct
        access to the identity map of the :class:`.Session`.
        If the given primary key identifier is present
        in the local identity map, the object is returned
        directly from this collection and no SQL is emitted,
        unless the object has been marked fully expired.
        If not present,
        a SELECT is performed in order to locate the object.

        :meth:`_orm.Session.get` also will perform a check if
        the object is present in the identity map and
        marked as expired - a SELECT
        is emitted to refresh the object as well as to
        ensure that the row is still present.
        If not, :class:`~sqlalchemy.orm.exc.ObjectDeletedError` is raised.

        :param entity: a mapped class or :class:`.Mapper` indicating the
         type of entity to be loaded.

        :param ident: A scalar, tuple, or dictionary representing the
         primary key.  For a composite (e.g. multiple column) primary key,
         a tuple or dictionary should be passed.

         For a single-column primary key, the scalar calling form is typically
         the most expedient.  If the primary key of a row is the value "5",
         the call looks like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, 5)

         The tuple form contains primary key values typically in
         the order in which they correspond to the mapped
         :class:`_schema.Table`
         object's primary key columns, or if the
         :paramref:`_orm.Mapper.primary_key` configuration parameter were
         used, in
         the order used for that parameter. For example, if the primary key
         of a row is represented by the integer
         digits "5, 10" the call would look like::

             my_object = session.get(SomeClass, (5, 10))

         The dictionary form should include as keys the mapped attribute names
         corresponding to each element of the primary key.  If the mapped class
         has the attributes ``id``, ``version_id`` as the attributes which
         store the object's primary key value, the call would look like::

            my_object = session.get(SomeClass, {"id": 5, "version_id": 10})

        :param options: optional sequence of loader options which will be
         applied to the query, if one is emitted.

        :param populate_existing: causes the method to unconditionally emit
         a SQL query and refresh the object with the newly loaded data,
         regardless of whether or not the object is already present.

        :param with_for_update: optional boolean ``True`` indicating FOR UPDATE
          should be used, or may be a dictionary containing flags to
          indicate a more specific set of FOR UPDATE flags for the SELECT;
          flags should match the parameters of
          :meth:`_query.Query.with_for_update`.
          Supersedes the :paramref:`.Session.refresh.lockmode` parameter.

        :param execution_options: optional dictionary of execution options,
         which will be associated with the query execution if one is emitted.
         This dictionary can provide a subset of the options that are
         accepted by :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`, and may
         also provide additional options understood only in an ORM context.

        within this :class:`.Session`.

        :meth:`.Session.merge` examines the primary key attributes of the
        source instance, and attempts to reconcile it with an instance of the
        same primary key in the session.   If not found locally, it attempts
        to load the object from the database based on primary key, and if
        none can be located, creates a new instance.  The state of each
        attribute on the source instance is then copied to the target
        instance.  The resulting target instance is then returned by the
        method; the original source instance is left unmodified, and
        un-associated with the :class:`.Session` if not already.

        This operation cascades to associated instances if the association is
        mapped with ``cascade="merge"``.

        :param instance: Instance to be merged.
        :param load: Boolean, when False, :meth:`.merge` switches into
         a "high performance" mode which causes it to forego emitting history
         events as well as all database access.  This flag is used for
         cases such as transferring graphs of objects into a :class:`.Session`
         from a second level cache, or to transfer just-loaded objects
         into the :class:`.Session` owned by a worker thread or process
         without re-querying the database.

         The ``load=False`` use case adds the caveat that the given
         object has to be in a "clean" state, that is, has no pending changes
         to be flushed - even if the incoming object is detached from any
         :class:`.Session`.   This is so that when
         the merge operation populates local attributes and
         cascades to related objects and
         collections, the values can be "stamped" onto the
         target object as is, without generating any history or attribute
         events, and without the need to reconcile the incoming data with
         any existing related objects or collections that might not
         be loaded.  The resulting objects from ``load=False`` are always
         produced as "clean", so it is only appropriate that the given objects
         should be "clean" as well, else this suggests a mis-use of the
         method.

        """Associate an object with this :class:`.Session` for related
        object loading.

        .. warning::

            :meth:`.enable_relationship_loading` exists to serve special
            use cases and is not recommended for general use.

        Accesses of attributes mapped with :func:`_orm.relationship`
        will attempt to load a value from the database using this
        :class:`.Session` as the source of connectivity.  The values
        will be loaded based on foreign key and primary key values
        present on this object - if not present, then those relationships
        will be unavailable.

        The object will be attached to this session, but will
        **not** participate in any persistence operations; its state
        for almost all purposes will remain either "transient" or
        "detached", except for the case of relationship loading.

        Also note that backrefs will often not work as expected.
        Altering a relationship-bound attribute on the target object
        may not fire off a backref event, if the effective value
        is what was already loaded from a foreign-key-holding value.

        The :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` method is
        similar to the ``load_on_pending`` flag on :func:`_orm.relationship`.
        Unlike that flag, :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` allows
        an object to remain transient while still being able to load
        related items.

        To make a transient object associated with a :class:`.Session`
        via :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` pending, add
        it to the :class:`.Session` using :meth:`.Session.add` normally.
        If the object instead represents an existing identity in the database,
        it should be merged using :meth:`.Session.merge`.

        :meth:`.Session.enable_relationship_loading` does not improve
        behavior when the ORM is used normally - object references should be
        constructed at the object level, not at the foreign key level, so
        that they are present in an ordinary way before flush()
        proceeds.  This method is not intended for general use.

        .. seealso::

            :paramref:`_orm.relationship.load_on_pending` - this flag
            allows per-relationship loading of many-to-ones on items that
            are pending.

            :func:`.make_transient_to_detached` - allows for an object to
            be added to a :class:`.Session` without SQL emitted, which then
            will unexpire attributes on access.

         attributes have changed, and are thus to be the subject of each
         SET clause.  If ``update_changed_only`` is False, then all
         attributes present within each object are applied to the UPDATE
         statement, which may help in allowing the statements to be grouped
         together into a larger executemany(), and will also reduce the
         overhead of checking history on attributes.

        :param return_defaults: when True, rows that are missing values which
         generate defaults, namely integer primary key defaults and sequences,
         will be inserted **one at a time**, so that the primary key value

         and other multi-table mappings to insert correctly without the need
         to provide primary key values ahead of time; however,

         allows the full set of rows to be batched to the DBAPI.  Normally,
         each column-set that contains a different combination of NULL values
         than the previous row must omit a different series of columns from

        r"""Return ``True`` if the given instance has locally
        modified attributes.

        This method retrieves the history for each instrumented
        attribute on the instance and performs a comparison of the current
        value to its previously committed value, if any.

        It is in effect a more expensive and accurate
        version of checking for the given instance in the
        :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection; a full test for
        each attribute's net "dirty" status is performed.

        E.g.::

            return session.is_modified(someobject)

        A few caveats to this method apply:

        * Instances present in the :attr:`.Session.dirty` collection may
          report ``False`` when tested with this method.  This is because
          the object may have received change events via attribute mutation,
          thus placing it in :attr:`.Session.dirty`, but ultimately the state
          is the same as that loaded from the database, resulting in no net
          change here.
        * Scalar attributes may not have recorded the previously set
          value when a new value was applied, if the attribute was not loaded,
          or was expired, at the time the new value was received - in these
          cases, the attribute is assumed to have a change, even if there is
          ultimately no net change against its database value. SQLAlchemy in
          most cases does not need the "old" value when a set event occurs, so
          it skips the expense of a SQL call if the old value isn't present,
          based on the assumption that an UPDATE of the scalar value is
          usually needed, and in those few cases where it isn't, is less
          expensive on average than issuing a defensive SELECT.

          The "old" value is fetched unconditionally upon set only if the
          attribute container has the ``active_history`` flag set to ``True``.
          This flag is set typically for primary key attributes and scalar
          object references that are not a simple many-to-one.  To set this
          flag for any arbitrary mapped column, use the ``active_history``
          argument with :func:`.column_property`.

        :param instance: mapped instance to be tested for pending changes.
        :param include_collections: Indicates if multivalued collections
         should be included in the operation.  Setting this to ``False`` is a
         way to detect only local-column based properties (i.e. scalar columns
         or many-to-one foreign keys) that would result in an UPDATE for this
         instance upon flush.

    def is_active(self):
        """True if this :class:`.Session` is in "transaction mode" and
        is not in "partial rollback" state.

        The :class:`.Session` in its default mode of ``autocommit=False``
        is essentially always in "transaction mode", in that a
        :class:`.SessionTransaction` is associated with it as soon as
        it is instantiated.  This :class:`.SessionTransaction` is immediately
        replaced with a new one as soon as it is ended, due to a rollback,
        commit, or close operation.

        "Transaction mode" does *not* indicate whether
        or not actual database connection resources are in use;  the
        :class:`.SessionTransaction` object coordinates among zero or more
        actual database transactions, and starts out with none, accumulating
        individual DBAPI connections as different data sources are used
        within its scope.   The best way to track when a particular
        :class:`.Session` has actually begun to use DBAPI resources is to
        implement a listener using the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_begin`
        method, which will deliver both the :class:`.Session` as well as the
        target :class:`_engine.Connection` to a user-defined event listener.

        The "partial rollback" state refers to when an "inner" transaction,
        typically used during a flush, encounters an error and emits a
        rollback of the DBAPI connection.  At this point, the
        :class:`.Session` is in "partial rollback" and awaits for the user to
        call :meth:`.Session.rollback`, in order to close out the
        transaction stack.  It is in this "partial rollback" period that the
        :attr:`.is_active` flag returns False.  After the call to
        :meth:`.Session.rollback`, the :class:`.SessionTransaction` is
        replaced with a new one and :attr:`.is_active` returns ``True`` again.

        When a :class:`.Session` is used in ``autocommit=True`` mode, the
        :class:`.SessionTransaction` is only instantiated within the scope
        of a flush call, or when :meth:`.Session.begin` is called.  So
        :attr:`.is_active` will always be ``False`` outside of a flush or
        :meth:`.Session.begin` block in this mode, and will be ``True``
        within the :meth:`.Session.begin` block as long as it doesn't enter
        "partial rollback" state.

        From all the above, it follows that the only purpose to this flag is
        for application frameworks that wish to detect if a "rollback" is
        necessary within a generic error handling routine, for
        :class:`.Session` objects that would otherwise be in
        "partial rollback" mode.  In a typical integration case, this is also
        not necessary as it is standard practice to emit
        :meth:`.Session.rollback` unconditionally within the outermost
        exception catch.

        To track the transactional state of a :class:`.Session` fully,
        use event listeners, primarily the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_begin`,
        :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_commit`,
        :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_rollback` and related events.

    """A configurable :class:`.Session` factory.

    The :class:`.sessionmaker` factory generates new
    :class:`.Session` objects when called, creating them given
    the configurational arguments established here.

    e.g.::

<<<<<<< HEAD
        # global scope
        Session = sessionmaker(autoflush=False)

        # later, in a local scope, create and use a session:
        sess = Session()

    Any keyword arguments sent to the constructor itself will override the
    "configured" keywords::

        Session = sessionmaker()

        # bind an individual session to a connection
        sess = Session(bind=connection)

    The class also includes a method :meth:`.configure`, which can
    be used to specify additional keyword arguments to the factory, which
    will take effect for subsequent :class:`.Session` objects generated.
    This is usually used to associate one or more :class:`_engine.Engine`
    objects
    with an existing :class:`.sessionmaker` factory before it is first
    used::

        # application starts
        Session = sessionmaker()

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine
        from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

        # an Engine, which the Session will use for connection
        # resources
        engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/')

        Session = sessionmaker(engine)

        with Session() as session:
            session.add(some_object)
            session.add(some_other_object)
            session.commit()

    Context manager use is optional; otherwise, the returned
    :class:`_orm.Session` object may be closed explicitly via the
    :meth:`_orm.Session.close` method.   Using a
    ``try:/finally:`` block is optional, however will ensure that the close
    takes place even if there are database errors::

        session = Session()
        try:
            session.add(some_object)
            session.add(some_other_object)
            session.commit()
        finally:
            session.close()

    :class:`.sessionmaker` acts as a factory for :class:`_orm.Session`
    objects in the same way as an :class:`_engine.Engine` acts as a factory
    for :class:`_engine.Connection` objects.  In this way it also includes
    a :meth:`_orm.sessionmaker.begin` method, that provides a context
    manager which both begins and commits a transaction, as well as closes
    out the :class:`_orm.Session` when complete, rolling back the transaction
    if any errors occur::

        Session = sessionmaker(engine)

        with Session.begin() as session:
            session.add(some_object)
            session.add(some_other_object)
        # commits transaction, closes session

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    When calling upon :class:`_orm.sessionmaker` to construct a
    :class:`_orm.Session`, keyword arguments may also be passed to the
    method; these arguments will override that of the globally configured
    parameters.  Below we use a :class:`_orm.sessionmaker` bound to a certain
    :class:`_engine.Engine` to produce a :class:`_orm.Session` that is instead
    bound to a specific :class:`_engine.Connection` procured from that engine::

        Session = sessionmaker(engine)

        # bind an individual session to a connection

        with engine.connect() as connection:
            with Session(bind=connection) as session:
                # work with session

    The class also includes a method :meth:`_orm.sessionmaker.configure`, which
    can be used to specify additional keyword arguments to the factory, which
    will take effect for subsequent :class:`.Session` objects generated. This
    is usually used to associate one or more :class:`_engine.Engine` objects
    with an existing
    :class:`.sessionmaker` factory before it is first used::
